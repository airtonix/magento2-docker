# Magento 2

This is a working example of how you could implement `sensson/magento2`.

Although we have carefully crafted this example it may contain bugs, security
issues or other problems that we were not aware of at the time.

Please take extreme care when building your own environment based on this
example and understand what each and every file does first before you use
this in production.

Feedback, issues or pull requests are always appreciated.
